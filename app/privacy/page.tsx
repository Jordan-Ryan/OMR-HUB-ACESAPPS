            <h2>4. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
            <p>
              We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to third
              parties. We may share your information only in the following
              circumstances:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Within your community: Your workout data, event attendance, activities, and assigned workouts may be visible to community administrators (coaches) and other members of your community</li>
              <li>With your consent or at your direction</li>
              <li>To comply with legal obligations or respond to legal requests</li>
              <li>To protect our rights, privacy, safety, or property</li>
              <li>
                With service providers who assist us in operating our application
                (under strict confidentiality agreements)
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Currently, OMR‑HUB is available for one community. When you use the app within this community, information you share (such as workout completions, event attendance, activities, and assigned workouts) may be visible to community administrators (coaches) and other members of your community in order to provide the service.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the future, when coach communities become available, coaches will be able to create separate communities for their clients. Information shared within a coach's community will only be visible to that coach and their community members, not to other coaches' communities or to the general app user base.
            </p>
            <p>
              For individual users who use the app independently (when this feature becomes available), your information will be private to you unless you choose to share it.
