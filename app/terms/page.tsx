              By accessing or using OMR‑HUB ("the Application"), you agree to be
              bound by these Terms and Conditions ("Terms"). If you disagree with
              any part of these terms, then you may not access the Application.
            </p>
            <p>
              We reserve the right to update, change, or replace any part of
              these Terms by posting updates and changes to our website. It is
              your responsibility to check our website periodically for changes.
              Your continued use of or access to the Application following the
              posting of any changes constitutes acceptance of those changes.

            <h2>2. Use License</h2>
            <p>
              Permission is granted to temporarily download one copy of OMR‑HUB
              for personal, non-commercial transitory viewing only. This is the
              grant of a license, not a transfer of title, and under this license
              you may not:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Modify or copy the materials</li>
              <li>Use the materials for any commercial purpose or for any public display</li>
              <li>Attempt to reverse engineer any software contained in the Application</li>
              <li>Remove any copyright or other proprietary notations from the materials</li>
              <li>
                Transfer the materials to another person or "mirror" the materials on any other
                server
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              This license shall automatically terminate if you violate any of
              these restrictions and may be terminated by us at any time.

              <h2>3. User Accounts</h2>
              <p>
                When you create an account with us, you must provide information
                that is accurate, complete, and current at all times. You are
                responsible for safeguarding the password and for all activities
                that occur under your account.
              </p>
              <p>
                You agree not to disclose your password to any third party and to
                take sole responsibility for any activities or actions under your
                account, whether or not you have authorized such activities or
                actions.
              </p>
              <p>
                Currently, OMR‑HUB is available for one community. When you create an account, you may be added to this community automatically. In the future, when coach communities become available, you may be able to join specific coach-led communities or use the app independently as an individual user.
              </p>
              <p>
                Coaches (community administrators) have additional permissions to manage their communities, including creating and assigning workouts, creating programs and challenges, managing events and schedules, and viewing client progress. By accepting a role as a coach, you agree to use these permissions responsibly and in accordance with these Terms.

              <h2>4. User Content</h2>
              <p>
                Our Application allows you to create, store, share, and otherwise make available certain information, text, graphics, videos, or other material ("User Content") including but not limited to:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Workouts, including exercise selections, sets, reps, and notes</li>
                <li>Events, including session details, schedules, and attendance records</li>

                <li>Schedules, including circuit sessions and personal training schedules</li>
                <li>Programs, including structured training plans with week-by-week workouts</li>
                <li>Challenges, including long-term timed challenges with customizable goals (step counts, macro targets, workout requirements) and short-term community-led challenges (fastest times, longest distances, etc.)</li>
                <li>Exercises, including exercise videos, descriptions, muscle group information, and instructions</li>
                <li>Workout assignments (coaches assigning workouts to clients)</li>

                <li>Profile information and images</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                You are responsible for the User Content that you create on or through the Application. You retain ownership of your User Content.
              </p>
              <p>
                By creating User Content on or through the Application, you grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use, reproduce, modify, and distribute your User Content solely for the purpose of operating and providing the Application and its features.
              </p>
              <p>
                When you use the Application within a community (currently one community is available; coach communities coming soon), your User Content may be visible to community administrators (coaches) and other members of your community as necessary to provide the service. For individual users who use the app independently (when this feature becomes available), your User Content will be private to you unless you choose to share it.
              </p>
              <p>
                You agree not to create User Content that: (i) is illegal, harmful, threatening, abusive, or discriminatory; (ii) infringes any intellectual property rights; (iii) contains viruses or other harmful code; or (iv) violates any applicable laws or regulations.

              <p>
                We may terminate or suspend your account and bar access to the
                Application immediately, without prior notice or liability, under
                our sole discretion, for any reason whatsoever and without

              </p>
              <p>
                If you wish to terminate your account, you may simply discontinue
                using the Application or delete your account through the
                Application settings. Note that deleting your account will remove
                your access to workouts, events, activities, schedules, and other
